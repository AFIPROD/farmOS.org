<h1 id="farmos-client-native-app">farmOS Client / Native app</h1>
<p>Work has begun on a simplified farmOS app that works offline in both browser
and native app form. It will be installable on Android and iOS devices. The
goal is to create a fast and focused client app for day-to-day and in-the-field
record keeping that stores data locally for offline use, and syncs back to a
farmOS server when internet access is available.</p>
<p>The application is divided into two projects:</p>
<ol>
<li>farmOS Client: <a href="https://github.com/farmOS/farmOS-client">https://github.com/farmOS/farmOS-client</a></li>
<li>farmOS Native: <a href="https://github.com/farmOS/farmOS-native">https://github.com/farmOS/farmOS-native</a></li>
</ol>
<p>The "client" is where all of the UI and features are built. The "native"
project wraps that client inside a native app, which can be installed on
Android/iOS.</p>
<p><strong>This documentation is not complete. It is intended only for informational
purposes at this time.</strong></p>
<h2 id="releases">Releases</h2>
<p>Currently, since the project is in early alpha phase, we only have public 
releases available via Adobe's <a href="https://build.phonegap.com/apps/3295280">Phone Gap Build</a> service. If you're interested 
in signing up for beta releases via the Apple and Android app stores, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf0brjVUEKiwG1iw4D386iKgbpw5xQ-YJ3w-1iBdKXO-RyK0g/viewform?usp=sf_link">sign up 
here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>
<p>The client essentially represents a UI library; the native repository consumes 
that library, while also providing the client with the dependencies it needs to 
be able to run on native devices, via Cordova. Those dependencies are the data 
and login plugins, which perform data and authentication operations specific to 
the native environment. The client library is separated from the native 
implementation in this way is so that the client library can also be consumed 
by other, browser-based implementations, such as Drupal modules, or standalone 
single page applications.</p>
<h3 id="farmos-native">farmos-native</h3>
<p>The native repo currently performs two main functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>housing the data and login plugins</li>
<li>controlling the Cordova build process</li>
</ul>
<p>The plugins are already quite self-contained. It seems like a forgone conclusion 
that at some point we'll want to make them into their own independent libraries. 
They're actually Vue plugins, which is all that's preventing all Vue-related 
dependencies (and devDependencies) from being removed from the native repo, so 
that time might need come sooner rather than later. Anticipating that fact, the 
data and login plugins are outlined separately below.</p>
<p>Putting the plugins aside for now then, the native repo really becomes quite a 
spare repository, basically comprised of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>the configuration files and build scripts for npm, Webpack and Cordova</li>
<li>a mostly empty <code>index.html</code>, which just serves as a target for the build 
scripts</li>
<li>a <code>main.js</code> file, which only calls the client library and passes it the 
plugins as arguments</li>
</ul>
<p>Being concerned solely with the final build process, it really doesn't contain 
much essential code of its own, only serving to bring all the necessary 
dependencies and scripts together in one place. Then all it has to do is call 
the client library's load function and pass in the dependencies it needs. It's 
conceivable that the whole thing could be replaced with a Makefile.</p>
<h3 id="data-plugin">data plugin</h3>
<p>The data plugin supplies the client with methods for storing farmOS data on 
local disk with WebSQL, and for sending that data to a farmOS server via AJAX 
and the farmOS REST API.</p>
<p>Specifically, the data plugin is a <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/plugins.html">Vue plugin</a>, which implements</p>
<ul>
<li>Vuex subscribe methods, which <ul>
<li>listen for UI actions and mutations, then </li>
<li>dispatch actions to the db and http modules;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the db Vuex module, consisting of Vuex actions, which implement<ul>
<li>WebSQL transactions, then</li>
<li>dispatches actions to the UI's store (eg, to update <code>logs</code>' "cached" 
status);</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the http Vuex module, consisting of Vuex actions, which implement<ul>
<li>AJAX requests, then</li>
<li>dispatches actions to UI's store (eg, to update <code>logs</code>' "synced" status).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="login-plugin">login plugin</h3>
<p>I need to finish the login plugin's documentation once I've gone through and 
figured out the authentication process better, and fixed some issues with the 
way it currently uses Vue mixins, but structurally it's pretty similar to the 
data plugin. </p>
<p>The one crucial difference is that it also registers a Vue component, 
<code>Login.vue</code>, on the main Vue instance when it's installed by the client. There's 
a lot that's not ideal about the login plugin, but how it registers the Vue 
component could actually be a good model for how other components could be added 
dynamically to the client's core library, if we wanted to break up the UI itself 
into separate modules.</p>
<h3 id="farmos-client">farmos-client</h3>
<p>Compared to the native repo, the client repo has a lot more going on. The 
primary organizing principle for all this, currently, is the Vue framework 
itself.</p>
<p>The load function, found in <code>src/app.js</code>, is the main entry point. It is 
basically a thin wrapper for instantiating the main Vue object, and installing 
any Vue plugins that were passed in as dependencies. It's only a few lines, so 
perhaps it's easiest to illustrate how it works by including it here in its 
entirety:</p>
<pre><code class="js">export default (data, login) =&gt; {
  Vue.use(data, {store, router})
  if (typeof login !== 'undefined') {
    Vue.use(login, {router, store})
  }
  return new Vue({
    el: '#app',
    store,
    router,
    components: {App},
    template: '&lt;App/&gt;'
  })
};
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the login plugin is optional. Crucially, when the plugins are 
installed, they must be passed the Vuex store and Vue router. Also, the DOM 
selector <code>#app</code> is hardcoded here as the mount point for the Vue application. 
In the future, this selector should certainly be parameterized to allow more 
flexibility. </p>
<p>Beyond the load function, the client can be summarized as comprising:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vue components, which implement<ul>
<li>Rendering algorithms, based on current state of the Vuex store</li>
<li>Component methods, which dispatch actions/mutations to the store when DOM 
events are triggered</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Vuex store, which implements <ul>
<li>a state tree, representing the entire UI state (eg, an array of log 
  objects)</li>

<h2 id="development-environments">Development environments</h2>
<p>Currently, a local clone of the farmOS-native repository is required to run a 
development environment for both the client and native repos; however, you do 
not need to clone the client repo separately if you're only planning to work on 
the native repo. So, follow the steps below to set up the native repo's dev 
environment first, regardless of which you're planning to work on, then proceed 
to setting up the client environment only if you wish to work on the client.</p>
<p>The first thing of course is to clone the native repo from GitHub, and install 
the npm dependencies:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ git clone https://github.com/farmOS/farmOS-native.git
$ cd farmOS-native
$ npm install
</code></pre>

<p>You should now have all the dependencies you need to run the native app, either 
in the browser or via one of the platform SDK's. If you're main objective is to 
develop on the client, you'll probably want to do so in the browser. If you only 
wish to work on the native repo, it will have already downloaded its own copy of 
the client repo into its <code>node_modules</code> directory, along with all its other 
dependencies, when you ran <code>npm install</code>.</p>
<h3 id="browser">Browser</h3>
<p>The browser-based development environment can be started by running the 
following command from the project root:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ npm start
</code></pre>

<p>This will start the Webpack devServer, which will compile a development build 
and serve it from <a href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080/</a>. Changes saved to the files in your 
local repo will be hot reloaded automatically while the devServer is running.</p>
<h4 id="proxying-a-farmos-docker-container">Proxying a farmOS Docker container</h4>
<p>By default, when the Webpack devServer starts, it will set up a proxy service, 
which will route all AJAX requests and responses through <code>http://localhost:80</code>, 
in order to prevent CORS errors. This is assumed to be the address of a local 
farmOS development server running in a Docker container. This is probably the 
easiest way to get a development backend up and running, so if you don't already 
have a sever you can use for testing, see the <a href="/development/docker/">full instructions for setting up 
a farmOS Docker container</a>.</p>
<p>If you wish to proxy an address other than <code>http://localhost:80</code>, you'll need to 
change the proxy settings in <code>farmOS-native/config/index.js</code>. Set 
<code>dev.proxy.target</code> to the address and port of your farmOS testing server. 
Restart the devServer and it should now be proxying your new address. It may 
also be necessary to add new endpoints to the <code>dev.proxy.context</code> array as new 
features are developed and new endpoints on the farmOS server need to be 
reached. For more information, see the <a href="https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserver-proxy">Webpack documentation on configuring the 
proxy middleware</a>.</p>
<p>You will also have to install the Drupal <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/cors">CORS module</a> on your farmOS server in 
order to handle the way the client does authentication (hopefully this will no 
longer be necessary once we implement OAuth). Once it's installed, go to the 
<a href="http://localhost/admin/config/services/cors">CORS configuration page</a> and add the following line to the Domains field:</p>
<pre><code>*|http://localhost:8080||Content-Type,Authorization,X-Requested-With|true
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, when logging in to the client from the browser, simply leave the URL 
field blank. The devServer will then interpret all requests as relative links 
and proxy them accordingly. For some reason login can sometimes fail on the 
first attempt, but should succeed on all subsequent attempts.</p>

<h3 id="linking-the-farmos-client-repository">Linking the farmOS-client repository</h3>
<p>If you wish to work on the client repo in development, the first thing you'll 
want to do is clone it from GitHub and install its dependencies:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ git clone https://github.com/farmOS/farmOS-native.git
$ cd farmOS-native
$ npm install
</code></pre>

<p>Next, you'll need to direct the native repo to use this local copy of the client 
library, instead of the copy it downloaded into its own <code>node_modules</code> 
directory. Fortunately, npm provides a helpful little cli tool for just this 
sort of occasion, <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link">npm-link</a>. It basically just creates a symbolic link in place 
of the npm package in the consuming repository's <code>node_modules</code>. To use it, 
first navigate to client library to create a reference to your local copy of 
the client repo:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ cd path/to/farmOS-client 
$ npm link
</code></pre>

<p>Now, navigate to your local copy of the native repo, to point it to your local 
copy of the client, and start the dev server there, if you haven't already:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ cd path/to/farmOS-native
$ npm link farmos-client
$ npm start
</code></pre>

<p>Now whenever you save a change to the client repo, Webpack will automatically 
detect changes in your local client repository. Changes in the client or the 
native repo will then trigger the native repo's dev server to hot reload, so you 
can see the changes in the browser.</p>
<h2 id="native-build-process">Native build process</h2>
<p>The process for building the native applications for iOS and Android can be
broken down into 2 main steps: first, Webpack bundles all the HTML, CSS and
JavaScript modules into their final form that will run in <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/hybrid/webviews/">WebView</a>; secondly,
Cordova, with some help from the Android and iOS SDK's (Android Studio &amp; XCode,
respectively), builds the full-blown native packages (.apk and .ipa files,
respectively).</p>
<p>To build from source, you'll need to clone the farmOS-native repository from
GitHub:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ git clone https://github.com/farmOS/farmOS-native.git
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the farmOS-client is a dependency which will be automatically
installed as an npm package in the following step, so you do not need to clone
that repo.</p>
<p>Bundling the web assets with Webpack is fairly straight-forward. <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node</a>
(v.6.0.0 or higher) and npm (v.3.0.0 or higher) are the only system
requirements. Once Node is installed, you can install the necessary JavaScript
dependencies with npm, which is automatically included with Node. The npm
script <code>build-mobile</code> can then run Webpack to bundle the assets. All this can
be done by running the following two commands from the project's root
directory:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ npm install
$ npm run build-mobile
</code></pre>

<p>This will generate all the necessary files within the <code>www</code> directory, which
Webpack will create if it doesn't already exist. Do not alter these files
directly. They are optimized for WebView, which is basically a browser that
Cordova installs and runs inside the native application itself to render all
the HTML, CSS and JavaScript source files. The same files are used by both iOS
and Android implementations</p>
<p>All the web assets are now ready for building the final native packages. Both
platforms will require installing Cordova globally, via npm:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ npm install -g cordova
</code></pre>

<p>This, however, is where the process diverges into separate iOS and Android
builds. This next stage will probably comprise the most system configuration,
too, since it requires installing each platform's SDK (Software Development
Kit), if they aren't installed already. Of course, if you only intend to build
for one platform, you only need to install that platform's SDK and
corresponding system requirements; building for both platforms will require
installing both SDK's.</p>
<h3 id="android-build">Android Build</h3>
<p>To configure your system to build the Android app, follow Cordova's
<a href="https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/android/index.html">Android Platform Guide</a>" and the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/install">Android Studio installation guide</a>. This
will differ depending on your development machine's operating system, but Mac,
Windows and Linux are all supported.</p>
<p><strong>System Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Java 8</li>
<li>Android Studio</li>
<li>Gradle</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that Android Studio recommends the official Oracle JDK for Java 8; using
OpenJDK may cause errors. Also make sure to follow Cordova's instructions for
setting up your system's <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/android/index.html#setting-environment-variables">environment variables</a> and installing the
<a href="https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/android/index.html#adding-sdk-packages">SDK packages</a> for the Android versions the app will target. As of May 2018,
the latest version of Android that Cordova seems to support is 7.1.1, at API
Level 25.</p>
<p>Once Android Studio is installed and configured, make sure Android has been
added to Cordova's list of platforms, then you're ready to run the final build
command:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ cordova platform add android
$ cordova build android
</code></pre>

<p>By default, the <code>build</code> command will produce a debugging APK (equivalent to
running <code>cordova build android --debug</code>). If you want to build a final release
version, you'll need to add the <code>--release</code> flag, but you'll also need to use
your keys for signing the APK (see "<a href="https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/android/index.html#signing-an-app">Signing an App</a>" in the Cordova docs for
more details). Both the debug and release APK's can then be found at
<code>path/to/farmos-native/platforms/android/app/build/outputs/apk</code> after building.</p>
<h3 id="ios-build">iOS Build</h3>
<p>Only available on Apple OS X. Windows and Linux are not supported. For some
workarounds, see "<a href="https://andrewmichaelsmith.com/2017/02/developing-an-ios-app-on-linux-in-2017/">Developing an iOS App on Linux</a>"</p>
