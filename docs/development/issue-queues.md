# Issue queues

## Drupal.org

All farmOS development tasks, feature requests, bug reports, and general
planning/discussion takes place in the Drupal.org issue queue.

Drupal.org issue queue: [https://drupal.org/project/issues/farm](https://drupal.org/project/issues/farm)

## Github

If you're a Github user, we also maintain an issue queue for farmOS on Github.
You post issues there if you prefer, and they will either be addressed there,
or copied to Drupal.org and integrated into the roadmap.
