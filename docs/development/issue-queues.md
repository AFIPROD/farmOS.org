# Issue Queues

## Drupal.org

All farmOS development tasks, feature requests, bug reports, and general
planning/discussion takes place in the Drupal.org issue queues.

farmOS is comprised of many [projects], and each has its own issue queue. If you
aren't sure where a particular issue should be posted, just add it to the
[farmOS Distribution issue queue], and someone will move it to the appropriate
place.

## Github

If you're a Github user, you can also feel free to post issues in the
[Github queues]. They will either be addressed there, or copied to Drupal.org
and integrated into the roadmap.
