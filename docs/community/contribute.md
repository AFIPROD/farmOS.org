# Contribute

There are many ways to get involved in the farmOS community! You don't need to
be a programmer.

## Use farmOS

First and foremost: use farmOS!

Building a critical mass of farmOS users is the best way for the project to grow
and thrive.

If you are not already in the habit of tracking your farm's assets and
activities, farmOS is a great tool to get started with.

Or, if you know farmers who are in need of a record keeping tool - tell them
about farmOS!

[Farmier] offers farmOS hosting, and all proceeds go towards future development.

## Feature requests, Bug reports, etc

If you have ideas for new features or modules that can be built on farmOS, or
if you find bugs, add them to the [issue queues].

## Planning and General Discussion

The farmOS community hosts a [farmOS Monthly Call] via Google Hangouts. Anyone
is welcome to join.

You can also chat with people any time in the [#farmOS room on Matrix.org] or
the [#farmOS IRC channel on Freenode] (both platforms are linked, so chats are
shared between them).

## Sponsor Development

If you would like to see a specific feature in farmOS, consider sponsoring its
development. Create a new support or feature request in the [issue queues] to
get started.

All development thusfar has been done by volunteers in their free time. Showing
support with a donation or other financial contribution is a great way to help
the project move forward.

## Documentation

If you are interested in helping with documentation, create a new issue in the
[Github issue queue]. Or, fork the [farmOS.org repository] on Github, make
changes, and create a pull request.

## Development

Are you a Drupal developer? Or a front-end JS developer? Or just a farmer with
some free time this winter? Consider getting involved in the farmOS development
process. There's a lot to do! And the more folks who can get involved, the more
we'll get done! Feel free to jump into the [issue queues] to get started!
