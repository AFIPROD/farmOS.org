These videos demonstrate specific features in farmOS.

These scripts are used to create video demos of features in farmOS. Please read
this document and follow the recommended guidelines before making changes to
any of the scripts.

Each script has two types of content:

 1. Directed actions (denoted with an asterisk: *), and
 2. Spoken words (denoted with a greater-than sign: >)

For each script, there are two corresponding video files: one with a spoken
audio track, and one without. The one without audio can be used to generate
translated versions of the video.

Videos should be short and focused on a single feature or aspect of farmOS. The
goal is to have a collection of short videos that can be easiy shared via
hyperlink, or embedded in other documentation. Short videos are also easier to
update individually when new features or changes are made in farmOS.

Changing a script means that video and audio will need to be re-recorded to
match it. Changes to a script should not be committed to the repository without
also committing the updated video file. Therefore, scripts should only be
modified if there are significant changes in farmOS that would make the older
version obsolete, or if there are mistakes that need to be corrected.
