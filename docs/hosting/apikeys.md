# API Keys

farmOS includes optional modules for integrating with third-party services, like
Google Maps and Mapbox. These modules will add additional base layers to the
farmOS map. However, because these layers are hosted by third-party providers,
API keys are required to use them. Instructions for getting an API key are
available via the links below.
