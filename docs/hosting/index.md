This video provides an overview of the download and hosting options for farmOS
by Michael Stenta at [Farmier], how to get deeply involved with the open-source
development community behind farmOS, or simply subscribe for a hosted version
to start using it today.

Since farmOS is a web application, it must be hosted on a web server. This is
different than most apps, which you simply install on your local computer or
device. In contrast, farmOS is installed on a server, and you use your various
devices to access it over a network as a website.

There are two ways to get started using farmOS:

## 1. DIY (host it yourself)

farmOS is free software, which means you are free to download the code and host
it yourself. You can also modify and extend it to fit your needs. It is built on
[Drupal], which is a free and open-source web application framework. Drupal runs
on a web server, so it can be served to the internet 24x7. If you're familiar
with websites and how to host them, you can set up a farmOS site just like a
normal Drupal site.

For more information, refer to the [farmOS Installation Documentation].

## 2. Subscription hosting

[Farmier] is a subscription hosting service, started by the creator of farmOS.
Farmier provides hosting, automatic updates, backups, SSL security, and other
features. Subscriptions help to support the continued development of farmOS,
and are an easy way to get up and running with farmOS quickly.
