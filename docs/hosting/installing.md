# Installation

farmOS is a [Drupal distribution], so it is essentially a [Drupal] codebase that
combines [Drupal core] with a set of pre-selected contributed modules.

## Recomended release

The recommended approach is to download the latest release of the pre-packaged
[farmOS distribution] from Drupal.org.

The Drupal.org packaged release is pre-built and ready to go. Just drop it into
a hosted web server environment and it will work the same as Drupal. For more
information on installing Drupal, see the official [Drupal Installation Guide].

During the installation, you will be given a choice of which "Installation
Profile" you want your site to use. Choose "farmOS" and all the proper modules
and configuration will be set up for you.

## Requirements

You will need a web server with all the basic [requirements of Drupal].

**The only additional requirement is that you use PHP 5.3+.** Drupal 7 itself
only requires PHP 5.2+, but farmOS makes heavy use of the [Openlayers module],
which uses some newer features of PHP.
