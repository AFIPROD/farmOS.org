# Overview

farmOS is a web-based application for farm management, planning, and record
keeping.

It is built on [Drupal], which makes it [modular], [extensible], and [secure].

[Openlayers] is used for mapping and geodata manipulation.

For more information, read through some of the [Frequently Asked Questions].

## 2016 NOFA Summer Conference

Michael Stenta presented a farmOS workshop at the 2016 [NOFA Summer Conference].
It covers the core features of farmOS, how to get started, where to find help,
and how to contribute back to the project.

## Open Source

Both Drupal and farmOS are licensed under the [GNU General Public License],
which means they are [open source].

## Status

farmOS is under active development, but is still relatively new. The focus right
now is laying a strong [groundwork], so that others can more easily join in and
[contribute].
