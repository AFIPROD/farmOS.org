**
farmOS is a web-based application for farm management, planning, and record
keeping. It is developed by a community of volunteers and aims to provide a
standard platform for farmers, developers, and researchers to build upon.
**

It is built on [Drupal], which makes it [modular], [extensible], and [secure].
Both Drupal and farmOS are licensed under the [GNU General Public License],
which means they are [free] and [open source].

For more information, read through some of the [Frequently Asked Questions].

## Status

farmOS is under active development, but is still relatively new. The focus right
now is laying a strong [groundwork], so that others can more easily join in and
[contribute].
