# Getting Started

Since farmOS is a web application, it must be hosted on a web server. This is
different than most apps, which you simply install on your local computer or
device. In contrast, farmOS is installed on a server, and you use your various
devices to access it over a network.

There are two ways to get started using farmOS:

## 1. DIY (host it yourself)

farmOS is free software, which means you are free to download the code and host
it yourself. You can also modify and extend it to fit your needs. It is built on
[Drupal], which is a free and open-source web application framework. Drupal runs
on a web server, so it can be served to the internet 24x7. If you're familiar
with websites and how to host them, you can set up a farmOS site just like a
normal Drupal site.

For more information, refer to the [farmOS Installation Documentation].

## 2. Third-party hosting

The alternative to setting up farmOS yourself is to pay a third-party to host it
for you.

[Farmier] is a farmOS hosting service started by the creator of farmOS. It is a
subscription based service that provides hosting, automatic updates, backups,
SSL security and other features. The proceeds of this service help the 
developers to contribute more time to the project.
