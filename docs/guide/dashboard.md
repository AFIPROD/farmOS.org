# farmOS Dashboard

The first thing you see when you log into farmOS is the dashboard.

On the left is the farm map, where you will see any areas that you have
mapped. You can use this to navigate to records within farmOS by clicking on
an area and then clicking on the available links within the area popup.

On the right are the todo lists. The "Plan" shows all upcoming tasks that need
to be done. If you miss a task, a "Late tasks" list will also be displayed
underneath.
