# Logging events

Once you have your [areas] and [assets] in farmOS, you can start recording logs.

Logs are records of all kinds of events. You can be as granular as you want: the
more information you're recording, the more you can look back on and learn from
in the future.

There are a number of different type of logs in farmOS - each with it's own
purpose and set of fields. Some of the general log types are described below,
but there are also other log types that pertain to specific asset types.

## Activities

Activities are a sort of catch-all, or default, log type, which can be used for
general planning and recordkeeping of activities that don't fit any of the
other, more specific, log types.

## Movements

Movements are used to record the movement of a farm asset from one area to
another. Movement logs are the primary way that an object's location is
determined.

## Observations

Observations are used to record any kind of passive observation on the farm. For
example, seeing that a planting has germinated is an observation. This is a very
flexible log type that can be used for a lot of different things. It comes with
it's own "Observation Type" vocabulary for defining your own custom
categorizations.
