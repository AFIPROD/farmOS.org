# Quick forms

farmOS provides a framework for building "quick forms" for common data entry
needs. This allows a simplified and focused UI to be provided for fast and easy
recording of common events, while maintaining the underlying flexibility of
the generalized asset and log data architecture.

If you have the "Farm Quick" module enabled, you will see a new "Quick" tab on
the farmOS dashboard. This will have sub-tabs for each quick form that is
available. farmOS modules can provide their own quick forms which will show up
here. It is also possible to enable/disable quick forms provided by modules, so
that ones you don't need are not cluttering the menu structure.
