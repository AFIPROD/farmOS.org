# Compost

farmOS can be used to manage all types of compost production activities. The
*Farm Soil: Compost* module provides a generic "Compost" [asset] type, which can
be used with various [log types] to record activities, observations, inputs,
harvests, etc. The compost asset can be used to represent a compost pile,
[windrows], [vermicompost], [tea], or any other form of production.
