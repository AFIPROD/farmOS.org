# Equipment

farmOS can be used to manage equipment assets on the farm.

Equipment [movements] and activities can be recorded via standard [log types],
and a special **Maintenance** log type is provided specifically for keeping
equipment maintenance records.

## Equipment logs

In addition to the standard [log types] that all farmOS assets share
(activities, observations, inputs, and harvests), the equipment module provides
an additional log type that is specific to equipment: maintenance.

**Maintenance** logs can be used to record when you perform maintenance on a
piece of equipment. This can be a repair, a tune-up, an oil change, a cleaning,
or anything thing else that is maintenance related to the proper use and
functioning of the equipment. All your maintenance records can be organized,
categorized, and filtered like other log types in farmOS.

## Suggested uses

* Keep track of equipment location via movement logs.
* Record oil changes, repairs, and inspections with maintenance logs.
* Use activity logs to record equipment use.
* Track fuel usage with input logs.
