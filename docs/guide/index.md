# Introduction

people who will be using farmOS for record keeping and farm management.

If you are looking for information about hosting farmOS, or contributing to

## Logging in

The first step to using farmOS is logging in. All records are private by
default, and can only be viewed people with a username and password.

To log in, first you need to know the address of your farmOS site. If you are
hosting farmOS on [Farmier], this address will most likely be something like
`https://myfarm.farmos.net` (where `myfarm` is the name of your farm). If your
farmOS is hosted by someone else, they will be able to point you to the correct
URL.

Enter the URL into the web browser on your computer, phone, or tablet, and you
should see a login form. Enter your username and password, and click "Log in"
to begin using farmOS.

## Dashboard

The first thing you will see when you log in is the farmOS dashboard.

On the left is the farm map, where you will see any areas that you have
mapped. You can use this to navigate to records within farmOS by clicking on
an area and then clicking on the available links within the area popup.

On the right are the todo lists. The "Plan" shows all upcoming tasks that need
to be done. If you miss a task, a "Late tasks" list will also be displayed
underneath.
