# Forest

[https://github.com/farmOS/farm_forest]

The Forest module for farmOS provides features for natural forest and plantation
management. It includes a "Forest Plan" for organizing related records, and
utilizes the areas, planting assets, and activity, observation, input, and
harvest logs from farmOS.

Forest Plans allow you to organize records for a particular set of forested
areas and optionally record plantings, management activities, inventory
observations, and harvests. These records can then be browsed in the context of
an individual plan, or in the larger context of other farm operations.
