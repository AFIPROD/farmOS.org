# Organic

[https://github.com/farmOS/farm_organic]

The Organic module for farmOS simply provides two flags that can be applied to
assets, logs, and areas:

* Organic
* Not Organic

This allows you to flag certain assets, areas, and logs as organic or
not-organic. If you have a mostly organic operation, you may want to just flag
non-organic records. Or, if you have a mostly non-organic operation, the
opposite approach may be more useful (only flag organic records). You can
decide how best to use the flags for your record keeping and certification
needs.

In the future, more organic certification features may be built in this module.
See the module's GitHub project page to suggest features or take part in the
development.
