# People

farmOS allows a farm to have multiple "users" accessing it, and each of those
users is assigned one or more "roles" to grant them different levels of
permission.

## Roles

Three roles are provided with farmOS:

### Farm Manager

Farm Managers have access to everything in farmOS. They can create areas, add
assets, record logs, and change configuration.

### Farm Worker

Farm Workers have most of the same permissions as Managers, but they cannot
change configuration.

### Farm Viewer

Farm Viewers are limited to viewing farmOS areas, assets, and logs - but they
cannot edit anything.

The Farm Viewer role is useful if you want to share your farm's activities with
someone, but you don't want to give them the ability to make changes.

For example, if you are applying for Organic certification in the United States,
you can create a user with the Farm Viewer role for your certifying agent, so
they can log into your farmOS and see your records.
