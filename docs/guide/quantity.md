# Quantity measurements

Most [logs] in farmOS have the ability to record structured quantity
measurements alongside other details. These can be used to collect data about
your farm activities in an organized way, which can be analyzed later to
provide insights.

Quantity measurements can be added via the "Quantity" field on logs. More than
one quantity measurement can be added to a single log.

The "Quantity" field consists of four optional sub-fields:

* Measure - What type of measurement is this? Eg: Weight, Volume, Count,
  Temperature, etc.
* Value - The measurement value (a number).
* Units - The unit of measure. This can be anything you like, but it's always
  good to keep your units consistent, as much as possible, for later analysis.
* Label - Labels are just a text field that allow you to add an additional note
  to the quantity measurement. This is helpful if you have multiple quantities
  of the same measure.
