# Getting involved

There are lots of ways to get involved with the farmOS project.

## Use farmOS

First and foremost: use farmOS! Get in the habit of tracking your farm's assets
and activities!

## Share ideas, report bugs, discuss development

If you have ideas for new features or modules that can be built on farmOS, or
if you find bugs, add them to the [issue queues].

You can also chat with people directly in the [#farmOS IRC channel on Freenode].

## Documentation

If you are interested in helping with documentation, create a new issue in the
[Github issue queue]. Or, fork the [documentation repository] on Github, make
changes, and create a pull request.

## Development

Are you a Drupal developer? Or a front-end JS developer? Or just a farmer with
some free time this winter? Consider getting involved in the farmOS development
process. There's a lot to do! And the more folks who can get involved, the more
we'll get done!
