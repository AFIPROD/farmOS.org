# Getting involved

There are lots of ways to get involved with the farmOS project.

## Use farmOS

First and foremost: use farmOS! Get set up and start keeping track of your
farm's assets and activities! farmOS can become a new standard platform for farm
planning and recordkeeping - but only if a large community develops around it.

It may not be very pretty or intuitive right now, but it is a community-built
software platform, and it will continue to evolve and improve over time. Get
started now and invest in a project that can become something great!

## Share ideas, report bugs, discuss development

If you have ideas for new features or modules that can be built on farmOS, or
if you find bugs, add them to the [issue queues].

You can also chat with people directly in the [#farmOS IRC channel on Freenode].

## Documentation

If you are interested in helping with documentation, please get in touch via the
[Github issue queue], or by forking the [documentation repository], making
changes, and creating a pull request.

## Development

Are you a Drupal developer? Or a front-end JS developer? Or just a farmer with
some free time this winter? Consider getting involved in the farmOS development
process. There's a lot to do! And the more folks who can get involved, the more
we'll get done!
